# Performance counter

This performance counter will be made using **Go** and **Python** (mostly because these are the most performance-wise best ones) and **JavaScript** (because I know it rather well, thus I guess it makes sense to build it in JS as well)

## Why?

The whole idea of this repo is to be able to check if there's any significant performance of each API. Thus, I have to have a way to do it properly.
