# CLI

The idea is to create a CLI in `Go` for this repository

## How it might work?

Very low-level - the CLI would build the Docker images for each API, then contain them and provide user an interface to run performance tests for all APIs, for each API and to allow the user to use the API in each language (for manual testing/play).
